Each single element of the probability vector is the probability of bit having  the value of 1. When the probability vector is [1, 1, 1, ..., 1] then the sampled vector is [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, ..., 1.0] whereas it is [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, ..., 0.0] when the probability vector is a vector of zeros. The CGA (compact genetic algorithms) search is started using the  probability vector of [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, ..., 0.5] which produces random vectors of either zeros or ones.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> sample([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])\n5-element Array{Bool,1}:\n 1\n 1\n 1\n 1\n 1\njulia> cgasample(ones(10) * 0.5)\n10-element Array{Bool,1}:\n 1\n 1\n 1\n 1\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 1\n 1\n 0\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"cga/#cga","page":"CGA","title":"cga","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"cga/","page":"CGA","title":"CGA","text":"ErrorsInVariables.cga","category":"page"},{"location":"cga/#ErrorsInVariables.CGA.cga","page":"CGA","title":"ErrorsInVariables.CGA.cga","text":"Performs a CGA (Compact Genetic Algorithm) search for minimization of an objective function.
